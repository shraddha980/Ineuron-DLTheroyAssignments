    "Since images typically have very repetitive features, CNNs are able to generalize much better than DNNs for image processing tasks such as classification, using fewer training examples. Finally, a DNN has no prior knowledge of how pixels are organized; it does not know that nearby pixels are close."

In this case the Dense(4096) would be replaced with a 7x7x4096 convolution."
