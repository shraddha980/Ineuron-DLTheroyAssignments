    "A dropout network may take 2-3 times longer to train than a normal network. Finding a regularizer virtually comparable to a dropout layer is one method to reap the benefits of dropout without slowing down training. This regularizer is a modified variant of L2 regularisation for linear regression.Concisely, MC-dropout is a method of performing multiple stochastic forward passes with the means of activated dropout in a neural network during the testing process to provide ensemble of predictions that could reflect uncertainty estimations"

    "TensorFlow is an open source framework developed by Google researchers to run machine learning, deep learning and other statistical and predictive analytics workloads.Below, we are discussing some important TensorFlow Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Responsive Construct\n",
    "With TensorFlow we can easily visualize each and every part of the graph which is not an option while using Numpy or SciKit.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Flexible\n",
    "One of the very important Tensorflow Features is that it is flexible in its operability, meaning it has modularity and the parts of it which you want to make standalone, it offers you that option.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Easily Trainable\n",
    "It is easily trainable on CPU as well as GPU for distributed computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Parallel Neural Network Training\n",
    "TensorFlow offers pipelining in the sense that you can train multiple neural networks and multiple GPUs which makes the models very efficient on large-scale systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "g. Feature Columns\n",
    "Tensorflow has feature columns that could be thought of as intermediaries between raw data and estimators, therefore, bridging input data with your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "h. Availability of Statistical Distributions\n",
    "The library provides distribution functions including Bernoulli, Beta, Chi2, Uniform, Gamma, which are important especially while considering probabilistic approaches such as Bayesian models.\n",
    "i. Layered Components\n",
    "TensorFlow includes functions like tf.contrib.layers that produce layered operations of weights and biases and also provide batch normalization, convolution layer, dropout layer, etc.\n",
    "So tf.contrib.layers.optimizers has optimizers such as Adagrad, SGD, Momentum which are often used to solve optimization problems for numerical analysis, it provides initializers with tf.contrib.layers.initializers used to maintain the gradient scale."
